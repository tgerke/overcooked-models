## Overcooked models: Mixing prediction, explanation, confounders, and mediators

This is a one-hour talk which discusses the differences between prediction and explanation in statistical modeling, as well as how the common use of causal terminology in the prediction setting further blurs the distinction.

This talk was most recently given for the [Interdisciplinary Data Sciences Consortium](https://idscbigdata.com/) on 2019-09-27. Here is the full abstract associated with that talk:

> Statistical models are most often used for one of two purposes: (i) to predict a future observation from a previously observed process or (ii) to explain the causal mechanisms that underlie the observed world. In practice, a distinction between these two goals is often not recognized in the model-building phase, resulting in an inappropriate application of tools or concepts. One specific area of confusion concerns the notion of confounded or mediated effects, which are irrelevant in the prediction setting, but require special attention when the goal is causal explanation. This talk will provide a high-level overview of these concepts, and point to specific applications in the literature as well as software solutions that are tailored to the two distinct modeling goals.
