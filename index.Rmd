## More men die with prostate cancer than from it

- 5-year survival $\approx$ 98% and <10% of prostate cancer patients have fatal disease<br><br>
- 2.9 million men living with a diagnosis in US
  + 42 million latent (undiagnosed) cases!

## PSA screening trends determine cancer incidence

- PSA screening $\longrightarrow$ high rates of overdiagnosis and overtreatment
  + Up to 2/3 of prostate cancers are overdiagnosed, most are treated<sup>.smaller[1]</sup>

## An urgent clinical challenge

- How can we distinguish indolent from lethal disease?
  + Patients with indolent tumors could avoid overtreatment
  + Patients with potentially lethal tumors could receive timely treatment

## A different(???) clinical challenge

- What are the causes of lethal disease?
  + If we know these, won't we also know the answer to the previous question, "How can we distinguish indolent from lethal disease?"

## Good prediction models $\ne$ good causal models

---

## Explanatory modeling = causal inference

- Test causal hypotheses for mechanistic understanding
  + Randomized experiments/trials are a gold standard
  + Increasingly, causal inference is conducted by evaluating association patterns within observational data according to specific rules
  + Success: an understandable statistical model (e.g. regression) that fits data well according to an expert-guided mechanistic theory
  
## Predictive modeling = predicting future events
- Models that use input values to accurately predict future outputs
  + Study design includes training and validation data sets
  + Success: a model built in the training data which need not be easily interpretable (e.g. neural net) works well in the validation data

## Proof that good prediction $\ne$ good explanation

+ TL;DR version: prediction error is a tradeoff between bias and variance. You can use a biased model (in a causal sense) that has low variance to reduce error

## Simpler for good prediction $\ne$ good explanation

+ You can build good prediction models with variables that have nothing to do with mechanism

---

## RCTs

- Randomized experiments are the gold standard because they provide causal effect estimates
  + Boilerplate explanation: "Because randomization adjusts for all confounders"
  + Ok. But let’s make sure we’re on the same page re: what that means

# Correlation is not causation
