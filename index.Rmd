## More men die with prostate cancer than from it

- 5-year survival $\approx$ 98% and <10% of prostate cancer patients have fatal disease<br><br>
- 2.9 million men living with a diagnosis in US
  + 42 million latent (undiagnosed) cases!

## PSA screening trends determine cancer incidence

- PSA screening $\longrightarrow$ high rates of overdiagnosis and overtreatment
  + Up to 2/3 of prostate cancers are overdiagnosed, most are treated<sup>.smaller[1]</sup>

## An urgent clinical challenge

- How can we distinguish indolent from lethal disease?
  + Patients with indolent tumors could avoid overtreatment
  + Patients with potentially lethal tumors could receive timely treatment

## A different(???) clinical challenge

- What are the causes of lethal disease?
  + If we know these, won't we also know the answer to the previous question, "How can we distinguish indolent from lethal disease?"

# What are "risk factors" for death?

# Correlation is not causation

Except when it is
